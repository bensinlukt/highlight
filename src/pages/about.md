## What I Do!

Most of my time is spent designing or making video games, but I also have lots of hobbies. I make pixel art. I play drums in a band, DJ, and make music on my DS Lite. I go snowboarding, scuba diving and cycling.

I try to encourage those around me to slow down and find what they love.

## About Me

I love working on projects more than anything. I've been creating toys, gadgets and games my entire life, and nothing beats the feeling of seeing someone have fun with what you made.

I was fortunate to have a career in animation for about a decade before switching to game development. When I joined this bustling industry, it felt like I had found my tribe.
