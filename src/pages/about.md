## What I Do!

Most of my time is spent designing or making video games, but I also have lots of hobbies. I make pixel art. I play drums in a band, DJ, and make music on my DS Lite. I go snowboarding, scuba diving and cycling.

I try to take care of myself and those around me by encouraging everyone to slow down and do what they love.

## About Me

I love working on projects more than anything. I've been creating toys, gadgets and games my entire life. I try to weave the intangible into something that puts a smile on the face of those around me.

I was fortunate to have a career in animation for an entire decade before switching to game development. When I joined this bustling industry, it felt like I had found my tribe.
